Neural Network Animation: Create a visual representation of a neural network with nodes and connections that dynamically change and light up, simulating the behavior of neurons firing in a brain. This can be achieved with JavaScript and a library like d3.js or pure CSS and JavaScript for a more custom approach.

Interactive AI Brain: Create an interactive 3D brain model that responds to mouse movements or clicks, lighting up different regions to represent neural activity. This can be achieved with WebGL and libraries like three.js.

AI Matrix Effect: A matrix-like animation with binary numbers or symbols falling in a cascading manner, combined with some AI-related symbols and icons appearing intermittently. This is visually striking and represents the data-driven nature of AI.
